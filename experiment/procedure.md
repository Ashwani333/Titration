## Procedure:
1.Rinse the burette with the potassium permanganate solution and fill the burette with potassium permanganate solution.<br>
2.Fix the burette in the burette stand and place the white tile below the burette in order to find the end point correctly.<br>
3.Pipette out 10ml of 0.1N standard oxalic acid solution in a conical flask.<br>
4.Add a test tube full of sulfuric acid in order to prevent oxidation of manganese to form manganese dioxide.<br>
5.Heat the mixture upto 60oC before titrating with potassium permanganate.<br>
6.Note down the initial reading in the burette before starting the titration.<br>
7.The hot solution is titrated against potassium permanganate solution and simultaneously swirl the solution in the flask gently.<br>
8.Initially the purple colour of KMnO4 is discharged with oxalic acid. The appearance of permanent pink colour reveals the end point.<br>
9.Repeat the titration until concordant values are obtained.<br>
10.Note down the upper meniscus on the burette readings. Record the reading in the observation table given below in order to calculate the molarity of KMnO4 given.
